# coffeeshop-online-store
A mock coffee shop website where users are able to "purchase" merchandise.

This project was completed as part of a college introductory course to front-end web development.
The purpose of the project is to test our skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The premise of the project was to create an online store that mocks a login and register system (using cookies/local storage instead of a proper database), 
a shopping cart system and a mock checkout system.
